Home in the valley
Home in the city
Home isn't pretty
Ain't no home for me

Home in the darkness
Home on the highway
Home isn't my way
Home I'll never be

Burn out the day
Burn out the night
I can't see no reason
To put up a fight
I'm livin' for givin'
The devil his due

And I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning for you
I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning for you

Time is the essence
Time is the season
Time ain't no reason
Got no time to slow

Time everlastin'
Time to play b-sides
Time ain't on my side
Time I'll never know

Burn out the day
Burn out the night
I'm not the one to tell you
What's wrong or what's right
I've seen suns that were freezin'
And lives that were through

Well I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning for you
I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning for you

Burn out the day
Burn out the night
I can't see no reason
To put up a fight
I'm livin' for givin'
The devil his due

And I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning for you
I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning for you
I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning for you
I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning for you
